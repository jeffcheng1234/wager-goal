<h1> WagerGoal </h1>
<h2> What is WagerGoal?</h2>
WagerGoal is a mobile social media platform geared towards making bets within your network. It enables those with particular productivity/self-improvement goals in mind and those with a taste for light-hearted gambling with friends to easily wage bets of various stakes, ranging from cash and donations to dares and online challenges.
WagerGoal aims to transform existing stigma and norms around gambling and making bets, to socialize this practice and create a safe environment for those with an inclination to join.

<h2> Tech Used</h2>
WagerGoal is a React Native mobile application that uses firebase as the backend with firebase cloud functions for alerts and notifications of scheduling updates. It creates a platform where users can see realtime updates of video/image uploads to foster that competitive and fun environment.
